# SimpleWebWeather
Simple-Web-Weather  A simple site built by HTML, CSS and Javascript. The aim was to get used to using available open source API's
and integrating them into a project. I haven't learned any of that yet in school, so why not learn it anyways right? I received 
helpful guidance in building this side project by two mentors who are a part of React Vancouver. This project was intended to
expose me to API's and it did just that.

If you have any suggestions on what you'd like to see, feel free to let me know!
